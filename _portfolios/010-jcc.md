client: Jewish Community Center of San Francisco
agency: Uncaged LA
role: Creative Director/Designer – concept development, design executions, final production
details: 
  - The Jewish Community Center of San Francisco is the oldest Jewish center on the West Coast providing educational, social, cultural and fitness programs to the community. Along with the updated mission and vision, the JCCSF wanted to refresh their presence to the community with more approachable but vibrant look to invite a bigger audience.
  - I was invited to bring creative ideas and executions for this project from the beginning. In response to the organization’s new mission statement of “bringing people together to explore, connect and flourish”, and the new positioning statement of “cultivating connections for a more vibrant community”, I came up with this creative direction of "overlay of basic shapes". Those shapes represented the individuals in the community, and the vibrant colors and the pattern they make as a whole represented the vibrant community. This idea later was approved as an overarching theme by the stakeholders. After a few rounds of creatives, I became the sole owner of the project to develop and finalize the logo and the brand. With the final approvals of all visuals and statements, I developed an extensive brand guidelines, their UI, interior/exterior graphics, digital/print materials, and event collateral.
