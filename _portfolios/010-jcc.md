client: Jewish Community Center of San Francisco
agency: Uncaged LA
role: Creative Director/Designer – concept development, design executions, final production
details: 
  - The Jewish Community Center of San Francisco is the oldest Jewish center on the West Coast providing educational, social, cultural and fitness programs to the community. Along with the updated mission and vision, the JCCSF wanted to refresh their presence to the community with more approachable but vibrant look to invite a bigger audience.
  - As a freelance director / designer, I was invited to bring creative ideas and executions for this project from the beginning. In response to the organization’s new mission statement of “bringing people together to explore, connect and flourish”, and the new positioning statement of “cultivating connections for a more vibrant community”, I came up with the creative direction of overlaying colors of basic shapes to illustrate the “togetherness". This idea later was approved as an overarching theme by the stakeholders. After a few rounds of creatives, I became the sole owner of the project to develop and finalize the logo and the brand design. Star of David was removed from the old logo and the new mark stayed simple to be universal and for easy applications. With the final approvals of all visuals and statements, I developed a very extensive brand guidelines with detailed directions for elements. Based on the new brand developed and recorded in the guidelines, I also updated their UI, interior/exterior graphics, digital/print materials, and event collateral.
