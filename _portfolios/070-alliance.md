client: Alliance Shippers Inc.
agency: Uncaged LA
role: Creative Director/Designer – UI design (design concepts, executions)
details:
  - Alliance Shippers Inc. is one of North America’s top privately owned global logistics and transportation service providers. New design and structure for the homepage was long overdue when the client finally decided for an overhaul. 
  - I was invited to come up with some UI design ideas to participate from the beginning of this project. Once the more modern and clean design direction I introduced was approved by the client, I took over the entire project to design individual page layouts, header images, icons, colors and typography styles.
