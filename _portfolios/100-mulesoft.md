details:
  - Mulesoft commissioned the agency for an ad campaign and experiential/guerilla marketing ideas. I introduced this design for the initial creative round with the theme of “connecting everything together". As a whole, these connected pieces resemble a mule which portrays the narrative of “We (Mulesoft) connect the dots and everything else”. Experiential ideas were also proposed along with the whole campaign direction. Although this got a lot of love from the internal team, it was not selected by the client as the final design.
