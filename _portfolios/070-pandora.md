client: Pandora
agency: BIRD Los Angeles
role: Lead Designer – design concept & execution, promotional design
details:
  - Pandora was a leading music platform providing personalized listening experience to users. Prior to this project, Pandora used a traditional serif font, Mrs. Eves, for their logo and lacked brand design. The scope of this project was to refresh the their serif logo and to update the brand look while keeping the same theme of “lights”.
  - I introduced the light graphics using 2 circles (inner & outer) to illustrate luminosity which was an update to their old bokeh theme the client wanted to carry on. Although we recommended a sans serif font for the logo, the client had a strong belief that the serif is part of their brand. To find a happy medium, we introduced a modern sans serif font and added a much simpler serif to make it into a logo. Once all the design elements and the new manifesto was approved, I took part in developing the brand guidelines and the promotional collateral.
