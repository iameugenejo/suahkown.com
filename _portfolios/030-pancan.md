client: Pancreatic Cancer Action Network
agency: Pancreatic Cancer Action Network
role: Associate Creative Director/Designer – UI design (research, wireframing, creative direction & prototyping)
details:
  - Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is a leading nonprofit organization in its field with a well established patient support program and a great cancer research funding programs. Despite of organization’s great mission and effort, the web presence was rather poor. It had too many elements jumbled together and people found it counterintuitive to navigate through. The challenge for this project was to understand visitors’ behaviors and find the much simplified and appealing web solution while keeping all required functionalities.
  - As an Associate Creative Director for the organization who also serves as a hands-on designer, I owned the entire visual design of this project. In collaboration with the Digital Marketing team who conducted the behavioral studies and provided datas, I participated in the research in finding good UI examples. I then worked on the wireframes which was updated through collaborative sessions. We made sure all essential information with most clickthroughs (e.g. pancreatic cancer information) can be found higher on the page while organization’s communications are viewed easily as well. Turning the approved wire into prototypes with design styles including icon, image and typography was my responsibility. I also participated in the testing stage to get the pages ready for the launch.
