award: Bronze Addy National Award 2011 – Online Advertising
details:
  - Cisco Systems acquired a portable camcorder brand “Flip," and was in need of a national ad campaign to launch this lifestyle product to the consumer. The agency I worked for was awarded with this project after pitching creative ideas along with other well-known ad agencies in the country.
  - I participated from the brainstorm sessions and the initial concept development stages of the campaign as a Senior Designer at the agency. Once the final ad direction was polished through many rounds of creatives by directors, writers and designers, I applied the final designs into many deliverables including print and online ads, OOH designs and productions for major cities, microsite layouts, experiential/guerilla marketing creatives, TV ad end slate designs and many more.
