details:
  - BIRD Los Angeles was an award-winning agency located in Hollywood, CA. As a marketing effort, the agency decided to develop a “field guide of BIRDs" highlighting the significant pieces the agency produced through the years. Names and characteristics were created for these "BIRDs", and the habitats were mocked up with featured projects. I worked on many of the BIRD mockups which required intense image manipulation. I also worked on the entire book and the notebook layouts and took part in creating the infographics which communicated the results of the campaigns conducted by the agency.
