client: Tetris
agency: Uncaged LA
role: Creative Director – concept development, design executions & final productions
details:
  - The Tetris Company was seeking to freshen up the brand’s old merchandise look the company and the licensees produced. We were asked to come up with a comprehensive merchandise guide to distribute to licensees that is more on trend and stylish to appeal to broader audience.
  - As a freelance director / designer, I was asked to come up with some creative visuals for the initial pitch of the project. My idea of turning 2D Tetriminos (dropping pieces you see in the game) into 3D shapes to "highlight life" was selected as the overarching theme for the guide. I then took over the entire project to work on the guideline layouts, numerous graphic patterns to apply to merchandise and image mockups to show these applications. I also worked on concepts for OOH campaign and social strategy for the company.
