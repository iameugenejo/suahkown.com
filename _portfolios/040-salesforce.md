client: Salesforce Desk
agency: BIRD Los Angeles
role: Lead Designer – design concept development and executions for online banners, print, OOH ads & editorial designs
details:
  - Salesforce acquired a cloud-based customer support product and launched it as Desk.com. The need for an awareness campaign was evident and our agency was selected to solve the problem. After some brainstorming sessions, the directors decided a testimonial campaign would be a perfect fit.
  - The layout design idea came from the desk’s logo. There was a small talk bubble shape hidden in the alphabet “d”, so I pulled it out to utilize as a visual element that ties the entire campaign together. We created this campaign in partnerships with companies such as Asana, HotelTonight and SoundCloud, and marketed in major cities through OOH and online platforms. Each of those companies was assigned with its own gradient color to have a distinct look and that system worked especially well in the OOH situations since repeated colors become uninteresting after a while. Upon the completion of this campaign, I also worked on editorial designs for their booklets and other collaterals using the talk bubble design I introduced.
