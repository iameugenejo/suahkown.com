details:
  - Avery Products Corporation launched a series of label products targeting small business owners. The idea of microbusiness was booming at the time through platforms such as Etsy, so this was a great opportunity for Avery to market to the owners to brand their businesses with Avery’s customizable products. 
  - I was serving as a Lead Designer when this project came along and was asked to come up with campaign concepts and visuals as usual. I came up with this idea of “I am my business” from the thoughts that often times these small business owners feel personally attached to their “mini" businesses. I also developed the visual concept of owners posing with their labels which was approved as the final design of the campaign. Once the designs were finalized and approved, I participated in designing their online/printed ads and microsite layouts.
